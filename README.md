# ChatGPT-in-terminal-TEST
My first attempt at using the ChatGPT API.

This is just a test repository to understand how the code works, therefore this is a learning opportunity and not a professional project. You can see my professional projects in the other projects I have made, and if there are no satisfactory repositories, then please understand that either I have not coded any such codes, or something happened either on the front end or back end.

# Reproduction

To compile this code, please use Anaconda, utilize python 3.12 since that is most likely to work on one's machine since this python script has been constructed with such version, and use the openai library via pip install openai, git clone, and you are done.
